            <h1>Flutist Daniela Koch</h1>
            <h2>Works for Flute and Piano</h2>
            <p><span class="firstcharacter">D</span>aniela Koch, a 26-year-old Danish flutist, releases a follow-up recording to her debut album, My Magic Flute. For her second album, Works for Flute and Piano, Koch compiled the most iconic sonatas in the flute repertoire—Hindemith, Reinecke, and Prokofiev—with a bit of French Enescu and the less frequently played Aria for Flute and Piano, op. 48/1, by Dohnányi, tossed in for good measure.
            <p>One of Koch’s strongest attributes is her ability to play softly in the low and middle registers while maintaining accurate intonation; her pitch never once goes flat. She opens the Reinecke with almost no vibrato—a technique I would normally be opposed to, but her varied use of legato makes the absence of vibrato hardly noticeable. I found the piano to be a bit dragging at times in the first movement; some overused rubato interrupted the flow of a work that is intended to represent rippling, undulating waters. Koch’s varied use of legato shapes this movement; she plays with a thin legato for the scale runs, creating an image of shallow, smooth waters, while she gives a thick legato to the opening theme in fifths. This thicker legato creates a soundscape of a deep, turbulent sea.</p>
            <p>Impressed by Koch’s soft register in the first movement, I was curious to see how she would approach the last movement, an impassioned, allegro molto finale in sonata form. Would a developed soft register be the extent of her dynamic capabilities? Koch opens the last movement with a forceful, steely sound, quickly putting my doubts to rest. Her gritty lower register projects over the Schumann-esque, virtuosic textures in the piano. Her ability to produce such an expansive sound can be compared to Emmanuel Pahud’s performance of the fourth movement of the Franck Sonata, or Galway’s CD of the Reinecke Sonata with pianist Philip Moll.</p>
            <p>The second movement, an ABACA trio full of large register leaps and awkward fingerings, does not challenge Koch in the slightest; in fact, it’s her best performance on the album. Her articulation is among the cleanest I’ve heard for this movement, and the frequent exchanges of 16th notes between flute and piano are performed cleanly and at a strictly metronomic tempo.</p>
            <p>Following the Reinecke, Koch plays the Prokofiev Flute Sonata, a work that exemplifies Neoclassicism at its best. Written in traditional sonata form, the Flute Sonata takes the shape of a Neoclassicist work through Prokofiev’s use of unexpected chromaticism. Koch plays with exceptional command in pianissimo upper register passages—one of the hallmark difficulties of this work—particularly for the restatement of the opening theme in A Major. Her rhythmic accuracy serves the work particularly well for the introduction of the second, march-like theme (3:50). Pianist Oliver Trendl matches her articulation and accents in his restatement of the march while Koch plays the first theme above. Koch performs the augmented arpeggiated runs at the end of the movement, which ascend to a beastly high D, cleanly, evenly, and in tune—a rare feat.</p>

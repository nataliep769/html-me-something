<p>I am a writer, editor and critic specializing in the arts. In 2014 I graduated from Indiana University with a degree in English literature. I completed a master’s degree at Syracuse University’s Goldring Arts Journalism program, a division of the college’s renowned S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. I have published reviews and feature pieces with Fanfare Magazine, Charleston’s Post and Courier, Central New York’s Café Momus and Syracuse New Times. I have also written content for the Bravo! Vail Music Festival and the Denver Philharmonic Orchestra. Below is some content I have written about different composers.</p>
    <article>
    <h2>Mozart</h2>
        <p>During one whirlwind summer in 1788, Mozart started and completed what would become three of his most popular symphonies. His Symphony No. 40 is the second of those three. Thought to have been an inspiration for Beethoven’s Fifth, it’s one of only two symphonies Mozart composed in a minor key.</p>
    <h3>Compositions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Requiem</li>
            <li>Eine Kleine Nachtmusik</li>

    <h2>Rachmaninoff</h2>
        <p>Known for his unusually large hands, Rachmaninoff could reach a remarkably wide interval of a 12th on the piano keyboard between his thumb and pinky finger—most people can barely reach an octave!</p>
    <h3>Compositions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Piano Concerto No. 1</li>
            <li>Isle of the Dead</li>
            <li>Symphonic Dances</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Berlioz</h2>
        <p>In addition to being revered for his compositional talents, Hector Berlioz was highly respected as a conductor, writer and critic. His Treatise on Instrumentation serves as one of the leading resources for composers on how to write evocative music for full orchestra.</p>
    <h3>Compositions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Symphonie Fantastique</li>
            <li>La Damnation de Faust</li>
            <li>Rom&eacute;o et Juliette</li>
        </article>
        <article>
    <h2>Stravinsky</h2>
        <p>Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky, born in 1882 in Oranienbaum, Russia, championed the Modern era of classical music. His music experimented with atonality, extreme dissonance, and, in his ballets, barbaric imagery. The Rite of Spring, a ballet that Stravinsky premiered to a Parisian audience in 1913, was so radical that the audience rioted during the performance. The piece ended midway through because the dancers couldn’t hear the music over the enraged audience.</p>
    <h3>Compositions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Firebird Suite</li>
            <li>Petrushka</li>
            <li>The Rite of Spring</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Scriabin</h2>
        <p>A self-proclaimed messiah and synesthete, Alexander Scriabin met disdain for both his music and his eccentric philosophies. He believed his music could provide the listener access to a higher power and wrote his final work, Mysterium, which he never finished, with the idea that it would bring about the Rapture and human salvation. He also believed he could provide the listener transcendence by creating compositions that were synesthetic—works that were so replete with musical color they would allow the listener to depart from reality.</p>
    <h3>Compositions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The Poem of Ecstasy</li>
            <li>Piano Sonata No. 7</li>
            <li>Piano Sonata No. 2</li>
        </ol>

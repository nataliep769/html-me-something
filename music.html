        <h2>Mozart</h2>
            <p>During one whirlwind summer in 1788, Mozart started and completed what would become three of his most popular symphonies. His Symphony No. 40 is the second of those three. Thought to have been an inspiration for Beethoven’s Fifth, it’s one of only two symphonies Mozart composed in a minor key.</p>

        <h2>Berlioz</h2>
            <p>In addition to being revered for his compositional talents, Hector Berlioz was highly respected as a conductor, writer and critic. His Treatise on Instrumentation serves as one of the leading resources for composers on how to write evocative music for full orchestra.</p>

        <h2>Stravinsky</h2>
            <p>Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky, born in 1882 in Oranienbaum, Russia, championed the Modern era of classical music. His music experimented with atonality, extreme dissonance, and, in his ballets, barbaric imagery. The Rite of Spring, a ballet that Stravinsky premiered to a Parisian audience in 1913, was so radical that the audience rioted during the performance. The piece ended midway through because the dancers couldn’t hear the music over the enraged audience.</p>

        <h2>Scriabin</h2>
            <p>A self-proclaimed messiah and synesthete, Alexander Scriabin met disdain for both his music and his eccentric philosophies. He believed his music could provide the listener access to a higher power and wrote his final work, Mysterium, which he never finished, with the idea that it would bring about the Rapture and human salvation. He also believed he could provide the listener transcendence by creating compositions that were synesthetic—works that were so replete with musical color they would allow the listener to depart from reality.</p>
            <h3>Compositions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Poem of Ecstasy</li>
                    <li>Piano Sonata No. 7</li>
                    <li>Piano Sonata No. 2</li>
